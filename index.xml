      <description>LDAP Lookups For OpenVPN My coworker was having some issues with the ldap3 Package behaving oddly. This came about because OpenVPN Access Server 2.8.0 changed from python-ldap to ldap3.
The idea being, have OpenVPN authenticate with Okta and assign VPN Profiles matching your Active Directory (AD) Group.
The Problem He was trying to query the Okta LDAP endpoint for a list of Groups that a User belongs to.
Solution Once I installed Apache Directory, I could more easily view the query results.</description>

      <description>Notes I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to write a blog for a while to keep track of my development and scraps of knowledge. Here&amp;rsquo;s my experience between a few static site generators I&amp;rsquo;m deciding on.
